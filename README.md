- Azure Service Bus is a fully managed messaging cloud service and different types of applications can communicate with each other via a message queue. Message can transfer between the different applications and it includes metadata about the message and the encoded information in different formats like JSON or XML.

- It allows you to decouple different components of your application by enabling asynchronous communication between them.

- Azure Service bus is a mechanism that allow different components to communicate with each other  without knowing about each other and reduce the thight coupling between the components.

### ***Integrating the Azure Service Bus with an ASP.NET Core application involves several steps. Iâ€™ll outline the main steps below:***

- **Step 1 : Create an Azure Service Bus Namespace**

   In the Azure portal, create a Service Bus namespace that will serve as the logical container for your messaging entities, such as queues or topics.

- **Step 2 : Obtain the connection string**

   Retrieve the connection string for your Service Bus namespace. This connection string will be used by your ASP.NET Core application to connect to the Service Bus.

- **Step 3 : Install the required NuGet packages**

  In your ASP.NET Core application, install the ```Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus``` NuGet package. This package provides the necessary libraries for interacting with the Azure Service Bus.

- **Step 4 : Configure the Service Bus connection in your ASP.NET Core application**

    In your applicationâ€™s configuration file (e.g., `appsettings.json`), add the Service Bus connection string obtained in step. It should look something like this: 
    ```json
    {
        "ConnectionStrings" : {
            "AzureServiceBus" : [AZURE_SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING]
        },
        "AzureQueue" : [QUEUE_NAME]
    }
    ```

- **Step 5 : Create a Service Bus client**

   In your ASP.NET Core application, create an instance of the `QueueClient` or `TopicClient` class, depending on whether you want to send messages to a queue or a topic. Pass in the Service Bus connection string from your configuration file.

- **Step 6 : Send messages to the Service Bus**

    Use the `SendAsync` method of the `QueueClient` or `TopicClient` to send messages to the Service Bus.

- **Step 7 : Receive messages from the Service Bus**

    To receive messages, you need to register a message handler using the `RegisterMessageHandler` method of the `QueueClient` or `SubscriptionClient` class.
